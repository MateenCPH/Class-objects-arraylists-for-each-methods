Task 6: Managing Student Records
In this task, you'll create a simple program to manage student records. You'll define classes to represent students and
a student database, and then perform operations like adding, searching, and displaying student information.

6.a Create a Student class with the following attributes (use appropriate data types and make them private):

String studentID
String firstName
String lastName
int age
double gpa
6.b Create a constructor for the Student class that initializes these attributes.

6.c Create a StudentDatabase class with an ArrayList of Student objects. Implement methods to:

Add a new student to the database.
Search for a student by their student ID.
Display all students in the database.
Calculate and display the average GPA of all students.
6.d Create a Main class with a main method.

6.e In the main method, create an instance of the StudentDatabase class.

6.f Implement a menu-driven program in the main method that allows the user to:

Add a new student to the database.
Search for a student by their student ID and display their information.
Display a list of all students in the database.
Calculate and display the average GPA of all students.
Exit the program.
