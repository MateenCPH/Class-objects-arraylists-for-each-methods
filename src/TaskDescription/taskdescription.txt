Task 3: Book Inventory
3.a Create a class named Book with private attributes: String title, String author, int publicationYear.

3.b Add a constructor for the Book class that initializes its attributes. Implement a toString() method to display the book's details neatly. Make all fields private and add getters.

3.c Write a Main class with a main method. Create an ArrayList called 'bookInventory'.

3.d Create a static method in the Main class called addBooks(ArrayList<Book> bookInventory, Book... books) to add multiple book objects to the book inventory. Test this method by adding books to the ArrayList.

3.e Create another static method in the Main class called findBooksPublishedBeforeYear(ArrayList<Book> bookInventory, int year) to find and display all books published before a specified year.

Task 4: Weather Data
4.a Create a class named WeatherData with private attributes: String city, int temperature, int humidity.

4.b Add a constructor for the WeatherData class that initializes its attributes. Implement a toString() method to display the weather data neatly. Make all fields private and add getters.

4.c Write a Main class with a main method. Create an ArrayList called 'weatherDataList'.

4.d Create a static method in the Main class called addWeatherData(ArrayList<WeatherData> weatherDataList, WeatherData... data) to add multiple weather data objects to the list. Test this method by adding weather data.

4.e Create another static method in the Main class called findCitiesWithHighHumidity(ArrayList<WeatherData> weatherDataList, int threshold) to find and display the names of cities with humidity above a specified threshold.

Task 5: Inventory Management
5.a Create a class named Product with private attributes: String name, double price, int quantity.

5.b Add a constructor for the Product class that initializes its attributes. Implement a toString() method to display product details neatly. Make all fields private and add getters.

5.c Write a Main class with a main method. Create an ArrayList called 'inventoryList'.

5.d Create a static method in the Main class called addProducts(ArrayList<Product> inventoryList, Product... products) to add multiple product objects to the inventory. Test this method by adding products.

5.e Create another static method in the Main class called calculateInventoryValue(ArrayList<Product> inventoryList) to calculate and display the total value of the inventory (price * quantity) and return it.

These tasks offer practice in working with ArrayLists and objects in the context of a book inventory, weather data, and product inventory management.
