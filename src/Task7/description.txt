Task 5: Employee Management System
In this task, you'll create a basic Employee Management System. You'll define classes to represent employees, an
employee database, and perform operations like adding, searching, and displaying employee information.

5.a Create an Employee class with the following attributes (use appropriate data types and make them private):

int employeeID
String firstName
String lastName
double salary
int age
5.b Create a constructor for the Employee class that initializes these attributes.

5.c Create an EmployeeDatabase class with an ArrayList of Employee objects. Implement methods to:

Add a new employee to the database.
Search for an employee by their employee ID.
Display a list of all employees in the database.
Calculate and display the average salary of all employees.
5.d Create a Main class with a main method.

5.e In the main method, create an instance of the EmployeeDatabase class.

5.f Implement a menu-driven program in the main method that allows the user to:

Add a new employee to the database.
Search for an employee by their employee ID and display their information.
Display a list of all employees in the database.
Calculate and display the average salary of all employees.
Exit the program.
These additional tasks should provide you with opportunities to practice working with classes, data structures,
and user interaction in your Java project.
